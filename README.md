# Github profile data fetched with GraphQL example

> Example app built to show one way of fetching data from Github and doing some basic visualization - [Try it out!](https://github-profile.now.sh)

# Running the app
In Index.js replace the part that says: _REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_ with your own Github personal token.

* Go into Github -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access token.
* Create a token that has the read:user right
* Put that token in instead of the _REPLACE..._ text
* You should now be able to just do npm start
